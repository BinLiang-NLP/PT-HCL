this trade war is so much more necessary than is being discussed . i understand we don , t want a conservative in the white house , but china is systematically stealing the world economy one company at a time . in another decade or two , we could see democracy fall to authoritarianism .

china stalling on the trade war . could indicate that it is n't prepared for a change in us-china trade relations . this proves trump caught them off guard and that they were arrogantly taking advantage of us and thought they could forever .

trump 's trade/economic war against beijing is justifiable , but instead of enlisting the assistance of friendly countries , potus alienates them & deploys 19th century style protectionism to safeguard mid-20th century industries . in case people thought he was a strategic genius .
