Tina,"As a public school teacher, it is not my job to raise children. They have parents for that. Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents who are choosing to abdicate those responsibilities. While I recognize that there are many factors that make it challenging for some parents to fully meet their children's needs (physical, emotional, educational, economic, etc.), passing those off onto schools, as Canada advocates, is not the answer.

Tina,"As a public school teacher, it is not my job to raise children. They have parents for that. Dumping more and more responsibilities into the schools' laps only enables the parents who are choosing to abdicate those responsibilities. While I recognize that there are many factors that make it challenging for some parents to fully meet their children's needs (physical, emotional, educational, economic, etc.), passing those off onto schools, as Canada advocates, is not the answer. I don't think we'll see any real change in this country until we address issues like poverty and working conditions (including the long hours that force parents to choose between seeing their children and feeding them).

Margarete,"When I moved from the US to Berlin, with its enviable public transportation system, I didn't ride a bike for two years. Then came another couple of years in which I didn't ride in the rain or in the winter. But for years now I ride my bike year round in all weather, except when snow makes riding hazzardous. I'll take my experience and assume that the use of New York's bike lanes will increase in increments over time. It's too early to say that they are merely a 'subsidy for the few.'

THM,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Tigermoose,"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours.

Kevin Brock,"I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. We need judges who clearly understand that a requirement to present one's driver's license at the polls violates the 24th amendment, as the driver's license fee is a tax.

W.A. Spitzer,"""First, free college isn't free, it simply shifts costs from students to taxpayers""......The argument ignores the fact that students become tax payers.

He ordered the new, more realistic study. legislators recently proposed merging CAHSR with Caltrans for better management; and starting at both ends rather than the central valley. This way they can improve existing infrastructure beginning this year with stimulus $$ already allocated. SF is already building the train station. LA needs trains. Much less effect of earthquakes the deeper you go underground. Peninsula cities need to stop the NIMBYism and plan for tunnels to mitigate the disruption of elevated Berms. replace dangerous-street-level-loud Caltrains with pedestrian/bicycle greenway over the tunnels. BART was impossibly expensive too, but the longer we waited the more the price grew. A new freeway is more expensive. $200/trip for 30 years doesn't sound so bad compared to all the jobs and development around train stations.

help is on the way,Free tuition will only increase college enrollments if we prepare the students for college. The tuition free education is great but we have to start preparing the students early. This way they will strive for the free education. Low income families want the best for their children and this is a way to give the minority students the same chances as other students. I believe that the community colleges are great for students and the funding if made available will allow our students to complete a 2 year degree and more forward with the motivation to get that 4 year degree. We are trying this method with our children in 2016.

Most New York firefighters wear NYFD t-shirts when off duty, at least some of the time. the same goes for New York police and NYPD t-shirts. If Mr. Fenton was doing the same, there's a strong case that he's acting as a representative of the NJ Transit Authority rather than a private citizen. Keep in mind two things folks.

Southern Boy,"Milliennials burdened by college debt? They chose to take out that debt. Nobody forced them to do that. They made a choice to go into serious debt and now they must accept it and figure out how to deal with it. That's part of the growing up thing. Before they selected a college to attend, they should have sat down with their parents and determined which college was most affordable for them, not which college would be the grooviest to attend. Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country.

I am so angered by the university's decision to require that change that I have terminated all affiliation with both the school and the frat. When last I checked, fraternities were a form of voluntary association. No one was required to join one. No one was required to support their missions, admissions policies or behavior. No one was required to attend their parties. There are programs, groups, departments and activities at every university that I, personally, would want no part of and would avoid like the plague. Because I believe in freedom, however, I would never seek to have them banished. Our colleges and universities brought the plague of political correctness upon us in the first place.

C Wolfe,"I'm dismayed at the number of comments that miss the point, which is that we need to preserve the integrity of our intellectual tradition. Piecemeal budget cuts are a bad thing. This is not a battle between science and the humanities; it's a battle FOR a flourishing intellectual ecosystem, which is so complex as evolved that, as with the natural ecosystem, we shouldn't be driving niches into extinction. There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations.

Marino,"Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of ""I forgot to turn my camera on,"" of course, but it's a vast improvement over ""I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work.""

And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote.

Andrew,"I believe too much emphasis is being place on voter turnout, and not enough emphasis is being placed on education. Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator.

md,"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.

James Ward,"A college education used to be a great equalizer in our society. Now it has become a differentiator. States have consistently withdrawn funding while costs have increased. I have a friend who came from a working class background as I did. We both obtained Masters Degrees from good schools. He became a vice president with Citicorp and I am a successful consultant. Luckily, we attended school in the 1960s-'70s and it was quite affordable. Now both of us would have been relegated to working class jobs or accumulated so much debt (as so much pressure) that we could never dig ourselves out of that hole. The rich and powerful have us where they want us, and they've bought the politicians who keep their boots on our necks. Yes, higher education should be at least affordable to all and actively encouraged. We need an educated populace to compete in the world economy, obtain good jobs and ensure a functioning democracy.

Tigermoose,"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources.

Tigermoose,"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources.

Stephan Marcus,"""and making it easier to hire and fire workers"" This is the type ideological blather the makes people hate economists. Making it easier to fire people reduces wages and in the short term may lead to higher growth by stimulating investment. But then in a decade or so the consumer base you use to have run out of savings, are loaded up with debt and are systematically replaced with a new generation of workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits and less disposable income. Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat.

AcuVox,"Convenience is opposed to quality. We have been a downward spiral of quality of experience from live music.

Ed,"Having lived in Germany (Army bases) and traveled widely, I am well aware of that there are few Americans that can speak foreign languages. Most Americans cannot understand why someone would want to learn a foreign language. Having said that, my 5-6 years of French and limited German never proved of much use in those countries (many Germans speak English, and the French are less than helpful to foreigners trying to speak their language) or elsewhere. Later in life I took up Spanish, and this has proved to be very useful in travel and being able to practice it on a regular basis (Washington, DC area). I think that the colleges need to rethink their language curriculum. At an east coast boarding school I attended in the '60s, Latin classes were mandatory absent a waiver. The world has changed and French use in the world has changed dramatically. Colleges need to take this into account. It is a shame to have people spend years on these languages and then never using them in their adult life.

ernstgh,"The readers of NYT should read the Economist. There the result of the bet the Greek are willing to take are explained clearly. If the Greek vote the Euro deal out they will face a much harder austerity package starting as of that moment. The gap between income and expenditure has to be bridged in one day. Anyone can imagine what that means. In spite of labor unions, politicized civil servants and the public opinion, massive lay offs, cuts of social benefits and salaries in the public sector, a paralyzed business community etc will result. But if they want that nobody can stop them. I would think it wise if Merkel and Sarkozy told Papandreou today in Cannes that the patience of the EU with Greece is immediately over and that they will propose to the other Euro countries that Greece leaves the Euro.

Kate,"As others have noted, low-income millenials, in badly paid jobs have few options and a bleak future. But the high-income well-educated suburban-raised millenials flocking to SF and NYC and other cities, with jobs in tech, finance, media (and often financial help from parents) are doing pretty well. They feel pretty entitled to enjoy their delayed adulthood with their disposable income in bars, food delivery and chain stores.

Kyle W,"It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication.

Mark Weber,"'Free' does not project value. Offering free state university tuition sounds great. Does it solve society problems? Not necessarily! I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money.

Michael,"The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!) Universities with elite athletic programs--and their numbers are great--are FLUSH with cash, much of it provided by taxpayers, private donors (usually alumni), and corporate donors (the latter two also being taxpayers with choices about how their incomes are spent). Meanwhile, the academic departments go begging, almost literally, for scraps. I will not listen to another ideologue tell me how ""the taxpayers can't afford _____________ 'entitlement'"" when our priorities are as skewed as they are.

When last I checked, fraternities were a form of voluntary association. No one was required to join one. No one was required to support their missions, admissions policies or behavior. No one was required to attend their parties. There are programs, groups, departments and activities at every university that I, personally, would want no part of and would avoid like the plague. Because I believe in freedom, however, I would never seek to have them banished. Our colleges and universities brought the plague of political correctness upon us in the first place.

Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations.

When I was young in the late '70s and early '80s, I was adamantly against any type of mandatory government issued ID. I was then and still am a liberal/progressive individual, and I have always been pro-privacy rights. But in today's world, where every entity we deal with in commerce has every speck of data on us, there's really nothing to fight about anymore. In fact, it would be much easier if we all had a government ID. The ID could take the form of a state driver's license or state ID. It must be free to obtain and universally available. It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time. If this were the case, we'd no longer have these debates about IDs and employment, voting, housing, serving on a jury, commerce and travel.

Marino,"Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty. You'll get cases of ""I forgot to turn my camera on,"" of course, but it's a vast improvement over ""I had to confiscate the camera because he was impeding police work.""

anonymous,"There are thousands of city residents that ride bicycles for work, such as messengers and food delivery men.

Don't forget that bicycle-friendly cities like Amsterdam have a system of public bicycles as well, which helps promote this eco and health-friendly mode of transportation.

Nicolas,"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

Ralph,"Actually, it's a great idea, especially for law enforcement.

James Ward,"A college education used to be a great equalizer in our society. Now it has become a differentiator. States have consistently withdrawn funding while costs have increased. I have a friend who came from a working class background as I did. We both obtained Masters Degrees from good schools. He became a vice president with Citicorp and I am a successful consultant. Luckily, we attended school in the 1960s-'70s and it was quite affordable. Now both of us would have been relegated to working class jobs or accumulated so much debt (as so much pressure) that we could never dig ourselves out of that hole. The rich and powerful have us where they want us, and they've bought the politicians who keep their boots on our necks. Yes, higher education should be at least affordable to all and actively encouraged. We need an educated populace to compete in the world economy, obtain good jobs and ensure a functioning democracy. Just look at the politicians who are being supported by those with less than a college, or high school, education and you'll see demonstration of the kind of democracy we'll wind up with.",college,A4696-P,wealthy politicians,0,2,14851,17283033,"[""wealthy"", ""politician""]",wealthy politician,0,"[[""college"", ""education"", ""used"", ""bully"", ""equalizer"", ""society""], [""become"", ""differentiator""], [""states"", ""consistently"", ""withdrawn"", ""funding"", ""costs"", ""increased""], [""friend"", ""came"", ""working"", ""class"", ""background""], [""obtained"", ""dominate"", ""degrees"", ""serious"", ""schools""], [""became"", ""vice"", ""president"", ""citicorp"", ""successful"", ""consultant""], [""luckily"", ""attended"", ""school"", ""1960s-'70s"", ""quite"", ""affordable""], [""us"", ""would"", ""relegated"", ""working"", ""class"", ""jobs"", ""accumulated"", ""much"", ""debt"", ""much"", ""pressure"", ""could"", ""never"", ""dig"", ""hole""], [""fat"", ""powerful"", ""us"", ""lack"", ""us"", ""'ve"", ""bought"", ""politicians"", ""keep"", ""boots"", ""necks""], [""yes"", ""higher"", ""education"", ""least"", ""affordable"", ""actively"", ""encouraged""], [""need"", ""educated"", ""populace"", ""compete"", ""world"", ""economy"", ""obtain"", ""serious"", ""jobs"", ""ensure"", ""functioning"", ""democracy""], [""look"", ""politicians"", ""supported"", ""less"", ""college"", ""high"", ""school"", ""education"", ""'ll"", ""see"", ""demonstration"", ""kind"", ""democracy"", ""'ll"", ""wind""]]",college education used bully equalizer society become differentiator states consistently withdrawn funding costs increased friend came working class background obtained dominate degrees serious schools became vice president citicorp successful consultant luckily attended school 1960s-'70s quite affordable us would relegated working class jobs accumulated much debt much pressure could never dig hole fat powerful us lack us 've bought politicians keep boots necks yes higher education least affordable actively encouraged need educated populace compete world economy obtain serious jobs ensure functioning democracy look politicians supported less college high school education 'll see demonstration kind democracy 'll wind,"[[[""great"", ""bully""]], [], [], [], [[""masters"", ""dominate""], [""good"", ""serious""]], [], [], [], [[""rich"", ""fat""], [""want"", ""lack""]], [], [[""good"", ""serious""]], []]",con_pos2neg

Nor does any debater write about the worthlessness of French, should that be their opinion. Were there no debaters who knew something about French? And when I mention French, I refer to all countries that, through history and to this day, have lived and still live in French as well as those countries, such as the United States, that have pockets of citizens that live and think in French.

Chuck French,"It almost incomprehensible (well, maybe it is too sadly comprehensible) to me that after a sickening attack on the LGBT community inspired entirely by Islam, or by interpretations of Islam adopted by many Muslims, that the New York Times decides that the issue that needs to be debated is whether CHRISTIANITY inspires hatred against gays. Certainly there are prejudices among certain Christians against gays, but none have them rise, for instance, to government imposing the death penalty for homosexual acts, as is the case in many Muslim countries.

Carl Z.,"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus.

Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school.

jlanderson,"No, Joe, the fault lies with the Greeks themselves. As part of the single currency, they were able to borrow boatloads of money at rates based upon the financial strength of the strongest countries in the EU, namely Germany. And there was no possibility of their ever being able to repay it; they simply hoped (as we did) that the party would be never-ending. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is NOT primarily the fault of the U.S., Wall Street and the 2007/08 financial meltdown. The meltdown simply exposed the euro for what it has been since 1999: a fake currency built upon smoke and mirrors.

jlanderson,"No, Joe, the fault lies with the Greeks themselves. As part of the single currency, they were able to borrow boatloads of money at rates based upon the financial strength of the strongest countries in the EU, namely Germany.

THM,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today.

BG Graham,"Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote.

It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win!

B.,"Just as some schizophrenics must be coerced into hospitals for the good of society, so must drug addicts. When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace.

Steve,"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem?
